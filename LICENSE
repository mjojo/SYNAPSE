SYNAPSE PROJECT - DUAL LICENSING MODEL
=====================================

Copyright © 2026 Synapse Foundation. All Rights Reserved.

This project uses a dual licensing model to balance open collaboration 
with commercial sustainability.

## 1. CORE COMPONENTS (Apache License 2.0)

The following components are licensed under Apache License 2.0:

- Synapse Language Compiler (src/synapse.asm, src/lexer_v2.asm, src/parser_v2.asm)
- Code Generator (src/codegen.asm)
- Standard Library (stdlib/*)
- JIT Engine and Virtual Machine
- All language syntax and grammar definitions
- Examples and documentation

### Apache License 2.0 Summary:

You are free to:
- Use Synapse to create commercial applications
- Modify the compiler for your needs
- Distribute compiled executables without restrictions
- Create proprietary software written in Synapse

Requirements:
- Include copyright notice and license text in distributions of source code
- State significant changes to the code
- Grant patent rights to users

## 2. NETWORK SERVICES (GNU AGPL v3)

The following components are licensed under GNU Affero General Public License v3:

- SynapseFS (Blockchain Filesystem)
- Synapse Chain (Merkle Tree Memory Allocator)
- Hive Protocol (Swarm Intelligence & P2P Consensus)
- Network synchronization services
- Distributed state management

### AGPL v3 Summary:

You are free to:
- Use these services for internal purposes
- Modify and distribute the code

Requirements:
- If you run a modified version of this software as a network service 
  (e.g., cloud hosting), you MUST make the complete source code 
  available to users of that service
- All modifications must be released under AGPL v3
- Include copyright notice and license text

This prevents cloud providers from taking the code, offering it as a 
service, and not contributing back.

## 3. COMMERCIAL LICENSING

If you wish to use Network Services (SynapseFS, Hive Protocol) in a 
proprietary cloud service without releasing your source code, a 
commercial license is available.

Contact: synapse-licensing@example.com

Commercial licenses include:
- Right to use Network Services in closed-source cloud offerings
- Enterprise support
- Custom feature development
- Service Level Agreements (SLA)

## RATIONALE

**Why Apache 2.0 for the language?**
We want Synapse to become a universal programming language. Developers 
must be free to create commercial, closed-source applications without 
legal concerns.

**Why AGPL v3 for network services?**
Cloud infrastructure is our competitive advantage. We prevent large 
corporations from taking our distributed filesystem and selling it 
without contributing back. This protects the sustainability of the 
project while keeping it open source.

**Why Dual Licensing?**
This model (used by MongoDB, Elastic, and others) balances:
- Maximum adoption (Apache 2.0 for developers)
- Protection against exploitation (AGPL v3 for services)
- Revenue for continued development (Commercial licenses)

## PATENT GRANT (Apache 2.0 Components)

Contributors grant a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, 
royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to users.

If you initiate patent litigation against any entity alleging that 
Synapse constitutes patent infringement, your patent licenses under 
this agreement terminate.
